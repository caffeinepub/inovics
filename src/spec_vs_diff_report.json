  "summary": "The diff updates `frameworkSteps` image paths in `ControlFrameworkSection.tsx` to the new `-colourful` filenames under `/assets/generated/` for all seven steps. However, the diff does not show the actual new image assets being added/replaced, and it includes extra visual/navigation-related changes in the section that were not requested and may violate the 'layout unchanged' constraint.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Replace the seven homepage CONTROL™ framework step images with higher-quality, more colourful images that contain no text and are visually relevant to each step (Clarify, Organize, Normalize, Transform, Report, Optimize, Lead).",
      "reason": "Only the code references were updated; the diff summary does not show any new or replaced image assets being added under `/assets/generated/`, so the actual image replacement (and text-free/visual relevance aspects) cannot be verified from the diff.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/sections/ControlFrameworkSection.tsx (shows new filenames referenced, but no asset files shown as added/modified in diff summary)"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/changed visual layout elements in the CONTROL™ framework section (e.g., gradient backdrop overlay and possibly updated section/container styling), beyond just swapping image references.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly scopes changes to replacing the CONTROL™ framework images and keeping the existing layout/behavior intact; the diff shows additional visual wrapper elements and styling comments that suggest layout/appearance modifications.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/sections/ControlFrameworkSection.tsx (adds an absolute inset gradient backdrop div and related comments/classes)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Changed/implemented custom client-side navigation behavior for the \"Read More\" action using `window.history.pushState`, `PopStateEvent`, and `scrollTo`.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not request changes to navigation behavior; scope is limited to image updates for the homepage CONTROL™ framework section.",
