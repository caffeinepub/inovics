  "summary": "Diff adds a new /industries standalone page, updates TopNav to route \"Industries\" to /industries, adds an Industries lead-gen form using the existing useLeadSubmission hook, and expands backend lead storage/API to accept additional fields. However, the Industries page copy/structure appears not to match the user-provided verbatim content requirements, and some required Industries-page elements cannot be confirmed due to truncation.",

      "requirement": "All headings, subheadings, bullets, and CTA labels match the user-provided content verbatim (English user-facing text) across the Industries We Serve page sections.",
      "reason": "The IndustriesPage hero headline and supporting copy shown in the diff are newly authored (e.g., \"Industries We Institutionalize\") and there is no evidence the full user-provided publish-ready content was used verbatim.",

      "reason": "Only the hero and part of the \"Our Focus\" section are visible in the truncated IndustriesPage diff; the presence/order of the remaining required sections (industry blocks, consistency, qualifying, final CTA, and prompt block placement/format) cannot be confirmed from the provided diff excerpt.",

      "reason": "A copy-to-clipboard handler exists, but the prompt text shown is long and appears to be an instruction to generate the page (not clearly the requested 'short' prompt presented as a final page block).
