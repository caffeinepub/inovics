  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by removing the standalone “Strategy Session” link from TopNav’s navLinks. REQ-2 is implemented for the shared booking handler via a new/updated bookStrategyCall() that performs pushState + popstate + scroll-to-top, and TopNav imports it, but the diff evidence is insufficient to confirm all other CTAs across the site were updated to use this handler.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Clicking other CTAs that use the shared booking handler (e.g., \"Book Call\" in ContactOptionsGrid and CTAs in homepage sections) also navigates to \"/strategy-session\" from any current route.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the shared handler implementation (frontend/src/lib/strategyCall.ts) and TopNav importing it, but provides no direct code evidence that other CTA components were updated/wired to call bookStrategyCall(). The only mention is in a summaries text file, not in the actual component diffs.",
