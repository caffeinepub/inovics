  "summary": "Diff adds a new HeroSlider component and swaps HeroSection to render it inside the existing min-h-screen hero wrapper. Slider slides/CTAs and prefers-reduced-motion hook are implemented, but key acceptance criteria around swipe/drag, visible desktop controls, and accessibility (keyboard + ARIA) cannot be fully verified from the truncated HeroSlider diff. Diff summary also indicates multiple unrelated site-wide/content changes beyond the hero slider request.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Users can change slides on mobile via horizontal swipe/drag; users can change slides on desktop via visible navigation controls (e.g., arrows and/or dots).",
      "reason": "HeroSlider includes state and comments for drag/swipe handling and imports chevron icons, but the relevant event handlers and rendered navigation controls are not present in the visible (truncated) diff, so implementation cannot be confirmed from provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "Add accessibility and motion-safe behavior: support keyboard navigation (left/right), provide ARIA labeling for slide controls, ensure focus styles are visible, and respect prefers-reduced-motion (disable autoplay/animated transitions if implemented).",
      "reason": "The diff shows prefers-reduced-motion usage for scroll behavior, but does not show any keyboard handlers (e.g., keydown for left/right), ARIA labels for controls/indicators, or focus styling. Autoplay/transition handling is also not visible in the truncated content.",
