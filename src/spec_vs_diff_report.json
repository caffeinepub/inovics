Additionally, changes appear to include out-of-scope metadata/documentation files not requested by the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add automatic slide rotation to the main hero banner carousel so the HeroSlider advances to the next banner every 5 seconds and loops back to the first banner after the last banner.",
      "reason": "In the visible portion of HeroSlider.tsx, there is no shown useEffect/interval logic to advance slides every 5000ms, no shown cleanup function for the timer on unmount, and no shown conditional disabling based on prefers-reduced-motion. The file is truncated before any such logic appears, so the requirement cannot be verified as implemented from the diff summary provided.",
