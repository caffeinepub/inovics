        "When the homepage hero banner is visible, the slide automatically advances every 5000ms.",
        "After the final slide, the next auto-advance returns to the first slide.",
        "The auto-advance interval is cleaned up on component unmount (no timers continue running after navigation).",

          "description": "Add an auto-rotation effect to advance slides every 5000ms, looping back to the first slide after the last. Gate auto-advance behind prefers-reduced-motion (disable when true), and ensure the interval is created only when the hero carousel is visible (e.g., via IntersectionObserver on the existing sliderRef) and always cleared on effect cleanup/unmount to prevent lingering timers after navigation. Keep all changes scoped to this file and do not modify any files under frontend/src/components/ui."
