The deck must follow the project styling notes: dark navy background (similar to #0D1B2A), yellow accent (in the #FFC300 range), clean enterprise look, bold typography, minimal bullet points, abstract data/grid visuals, and no stock/cheesy imagery or heavy icons. Use the exact slide-by-slide content previously provided in the conversation and keep the deck length within 12–14 slides (target 14).",
