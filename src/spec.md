# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Provide a downloadable INOVICS corporate presentation deck (Option 1 theme) from within the web app.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a 14-slide INOVICS corporate presentation deck as a PowerPoint (.pptx) using the provided slide-by-slide titles and body text, styled to match Option 1 (dark navy background, yellow accent, clean enterprise layout, bold headings, minimal bullets, abstract/data/grid visuals).
- Add the generated .pptx to the frontend as a static public asset.
- Add a clear UI entry point (e.g., “Download Corporate Deck (PPTX)”) that downloads the .pptx successfully in production builds.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can download the INOVICS corporate deck as a .pptx directly from the site via a clearly labeled download link/button.
