# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dedicated “The CONTROL™ Framework” page, link to it from the homepage and main menu, and include a lead-generation form that captures submissions with an on-page success state.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new standalone “The CONTROL™ Framework” page with the exact user-provided English copy and section order, including two CTAs labeled “Book a Founder Strategy Call” that follow the site’s existing strategy-call/contact behavior.
- Add a visible “Read more” (or equivalent) link on the homepage that navigates to the new CONTROL™ Framework page.
- Add a main navigation menu entry (desktop and mobile) that routes to the CONTROL™ Framework page while keeping existing homepage smooth-scroll/scroll-spy behavior for other menu items.
- Implement the CONTROL™ lead-generation form mid-page with the specified fields, dropdown options (including ₹5–10 Cr / ₹10–25 Cr / ₹25–50 Cr / 50+ Cr), button text “Request Blueprint Review”, and the specified small text under the button, plus basic client-side validation.
- Add backend + frontend wiring to submit and persist lead form submissions (including server timestamp) and show a clear inline success confirmation without unexpected navigation.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a dedicated CONTROL™ Framework page from the homepage or main menu, read the full framework content, click “Book a Founder Strategy Call” CTAs, and submit a lead form that confirms successful submission on the page.
