# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Generate and add the complete INOVICS corporate presentation deck as a downloadable PowerPoint (.pptx) file within the project repository.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a 12–14 slide (target 14) INOVICS presentation deck in .pptx format using the exact slide-by-slide content previously provided in the conversation.
- Apply the specified visual style (dark navy background, yellow accent, clean enterprise look, bold typography, minimal bullets, abstract data/grid visuals) and avoid stock/cheesy imagery or heavy iconography.
- Commit the resulting .pptx binary to the repository so it is visible and downloadable from the project’s Files panel.

**User-visible outcome:** A finished INOVICS .pptx deck is available directly in the project files and opens correctly in PowerPoint/Google Slides with consistent styling and intact layouts/assets.
